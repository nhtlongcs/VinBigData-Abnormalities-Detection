## Preparing data:
1. Use ```merge-bboxes``` to remove overlapping bounding boxes in the dataset (Optional)
2. Use ```split-data``` to split dataset into k-fold cross validation
3. Use ```convert-format``` to convert folder of k-folds to COCO/YOLO format

## Processing submission:
- Visualize submission file and calcule mAP score on two .json file with ```evaluate```
- Convert prediction .csv file (generated by model) to competition submission format with ```submission```
